## 1. Original Dataset Description: CMEMS GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030

The primary data source for this study is the **Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis (GLORYS12V1)**. This product provides a numerical reconstruction of the 3D physics of the global ocean, generated by the **NEMO** (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) platform. 

It utilizes a $1/12^\circ$ ($\approx 8.3 \text{ km}$) eddy-resolving horizontal grid with 50 standard vertical levels. Unlike raw satellite products, this reanalysis assimilates satellite altimetry, sea surface temperature, and sea ice concentration, along with *in-situ* temperature and salinity profiles, ensuring physical consistency across variables.

### 1.1 Spatial and Temporal Domain
The dataset is subsetted to focus on the **North West African Upwelling Region**, a dynamically active area characterized by intense mesoscale activity and filaments.

| Parameter | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Geographic Bounds** | 32.50°W to 11.50°W / 5.00°N to 26.00N° |
| **Temporal Range** | January 1, 2000 – December 23, 2025 |
| **Temporal Resolution** | Daily-mean outputs |
| **Total Duration** | 25 Years (9,489 time steps) |

### 1.2 Model Variables
The emulator utilizes one surface variable extracted at the **0.49m** depth level:
* **Potential Temperature:** Representing the upper-layer heat content.

## 2. Data Engineering

To prepare the CMEMS GLORYS12V1 dataset for the surface emulator, two primary spatial and temporal transformations were applied to balance physical fidelity with computational efficiency.

* **Temporal Resampling:** The original daily-mean outputs were downsampled to a **weekly temporal resolution** by calculating the arithmetic mean of each 7-day window. This reduces the dataset size by ~85% while smoothing high-frequency noise.
* **Spatial Resampling:** The native 1/12° grid (253x253 pixels) was upsampled to a uniform **512x512 grid** using **bilinear interpolation**. This ensures compatibility with standard deep learning architectures requiring power-of-two input dimensions.

| Transformation | Original Shape | Target Shape | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temporal** | Daily (9,489 steps) | Weekly (1,357 steps) | Mean Aggregation |
| **Spatial** | 253x253 px | 512x512 px | Bilinear Interpolation |

## 3. Final Dataset Overview

### 3.1 Dataset Characteristics
- **Dataset Source:** [CMEMS GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030/description)
- **Number of Observations:** 1,357 weekly snapshots (2000–2025).
- **Number of Features:** 1 spatial field  at 512x512 resolution.

### 3.2 Target Variable
- **Label Name:** Potential Temperature 
- **Label Type:** Regression
- **Label Description:** Weekly mean sea surface temperature at 0.49m depth.
- **Label Distribution:** Values typically range between 16°C and 29°C, following a strong latitudinal gradient and seasonal cycle.

### 3.3 Data Quality and Biases
- **Missing Values:** Land pixels are represented as `NaN`. These are handled during training by masking the loss or padding with regional means.
- **Feature Distributions:** The data exhibits strong seasonal non-stationarity and a long-term warming trend (2000–2025).
- **Correlations:** High temporal autocorrelation between consecutive weeks justifies the use of a Persistence baseline for performance evaluation.
- **Possible Biases:** Upsampling from 253 to 512 pixels via bilinear interpolation smooths sharp gradients, which may limit the model's ability to recover extremely fine-scale upwelling fronts.
