## Model Architecture

> **Note on Implementation:** Due to licensing and authorship constraints associated with the core backbone architecture, the raw model definition code is not included in this public repository. 

### Architectural Overview
While the specific code is restricted, the model follows these structural principles:
- **Topology:** A deep encoder-decoder framework (U-Net) designed for $512 \times 512$ inputs.
- **Latent Space:** Utilizes bottleneck layers designed to capture long-range spatial dependencies across the North West African Upwelling Region.
- **Optimization:** Trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
